  <h1>Trying Swift</h1>

<p> Something I tried at this mornings's learnathon! Sofia taught me and although I didn't finish my applet (yet), I had a lot of fun learning all about it. I learned it at an awesome event I organized called <a href="./HacKNight.html">HacKnight</a></p>

<p> My applet was about F1 teams and gave information such as each driver the team has, how many points they got in the current season, and how many championships they have won. Although I don't follow F1 too closely, I like watching the highlights and the engineering involved with F1 is mindboggling to me because it incorperates physics, engineering, and coding; all of which I enjoy.</p>
